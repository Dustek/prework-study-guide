# prework-study-guide

## Description

I created this project to help front-end students by providing an organised studying guide.
I also used it as an opportunity to learn coding concepts.
It creates a centralised place to make notes for me and other students, and even provides a prompt on what to study next.
I learned the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript while making it.
